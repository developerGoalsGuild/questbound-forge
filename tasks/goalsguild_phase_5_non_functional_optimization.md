**Labels:** `Non-Functional & Optimization` (red), `Phase 5 – Non-functional & Optimization` (red)
**Dependencies:**

> 10.1

### Description
Objective: Execute the task **47.1 – Setup i18n config in frontend** with precise, reproducible steps so an AI agent or developer can complete it autonomously.
Phase: Phase 5 – Non-functional & Optimization
Category: Non-Functional & Optimization
Primary Domain(s): Frontend (React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind)
Dependencies: 10.1

Detailed Steps:
1. Create or update a React component/page under `src/pages` or `src/components` following design system and accessibility guidelines.
2. Connect to backend/API using the existing client utility. Handle loading, error, and empty states with clear UX.
3. Add form validation (zod or HTML5 constraints) and optimistic UI where safe. Ensure keyboard navigation and ARIA roles.
4. Write minimal CSS with Tailwind utility classes; ensure responsive behavior for mobile and desktop breakpoints.

Acceptance Criteria (task succeeds only if ALL criteria are met):
- Unit tests created or updated for all new code paths; tests pass locally and in CI.
- Integration tests validate end-to-end behavior against a dev stack (mocked if necessary for external services).
- UAT checklist verified: user can execute the intended flow without errors; UI states and API responses match specification.
- Static analysis (type checks, lint) passes; security scans reveal no critical/high issues.
- Performance sanity check completed (basic latency/throughput or bundle size check).
- Documentation updated (README/OpenAPI/AppSync schema notes).

Notes:
- Follow project conventions for logging (structured JSON) and error handling.
- All secrets/keys must be read from SSM/KMS or environment variables; never hardcode.
- Ensure idempotent and retry-safe operations for external calls.

Dependencies: 11.2

Detailed Steps:
1. Create or update FastAPI route(s) in the appropriate service package (e.g., /services/*-service). Use REST semantics or AppSync resolver where applicable.
2. Define strict Pydantic request/response models. Validate all inputs; return HTTP 4xx with error details on invalid payloads.
3. Implement business logic in a separate service module. Ensure idempotency and proper error handling (try/except; structured logs).
4. Persist or query data in DynamoDB single-table `gg_core` using PK/SK patterns defined in the project. Include createdAt/updatedAt timestamps.
5. Authorize requests using Cognito JWT middleware. Extract `sub` claim for the acting user; enforce RBAC where required.

## 52.1 – Enable MFA in Cognito
**Labels:** `Non-Functional & Optimization` (red), `Phase 5 – Non-functional & Optimization` (red)
**Dependencies:**

> **2025-09-24 – Dependencies**
> 5.1

### Description
Objective: Execute the task **52.1 – Enable MFA in Cognito** with precise, reproducible steps so an AI agent or developer can complete it autonomously.
Phase: Phase 5 – Non-functional & Optimization
Category: Non-Functional & Optimization
Primary Domain(s): Infrastructure (Terraform/CloudFormation, AWS)
Dependencies: 5.1

Detailed Steps:
1. Update Terraform/CloudFormation templates under `infra/terraform` to provision or modify required AWS resources.
2. Run plan/apply in a sandbox environment. Capture outputs (ARNs, endpoints) and propagate configuration via SSM/ENV.
3. Set up or update CloudWatch alarms/metrics/log groups for the component. Add basic dashboards if applicable.
4. Document rollback steps and resource ownership tags.

Acceptance Criteria (task succeeds only if ALL criteria are met):
- Unit tests created or updated for all new code paths; tests pass locally and in CI.
- Integration tests validate end-to-end behavior against a dev stack (mocked if necessary for external services).
- UAT checklist verified: user can execute the intended flow without errors; UI states and API responses match specification.
- Static analysis (type checks, lint) passes; security scans reveal no critical/high issues.
- Performance sanity check completed (basic latency/throughput or bundle size check).
- Documentation updated (README/OpenAPI/AppSync schema notes).

Notes:
- Follow project conventions for logging (structured JSON) and error handling.
- All secrets/keys must be read from SSM/KMS or environment variables; never hardcode.
- Ensure idempotent and retry-safe operations for external calls.
