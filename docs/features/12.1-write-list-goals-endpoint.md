**Labels:** `Phase 1 – Foundation` (sky)

**Dependencies:**

> Dependencies: 11.2

### Description
Objective: Execute **12.1 – Write list goals endpoint** with precise steps that an AI agent can follow to completion.
Phase: Phase 1 – Foundation
Category: Auto-Inferred
Primary Domain(s): Backend (FastAPI, Python, AppSync/DynamoDB), Frontend (React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind)
Dependencies: 11.2

Detailed Steps:
- Create or update FastAPI route(s) and handlers; define strict Pydantic models for request/response.
- Implement business logic in a separate service module; add structured logs and robust error handling.
- Use DynamoDB table `gg_core` with proper PK/SK; include createdAt/updatedAt; follow single-table patterns.
- Authorize via Cognito JWT; extract `sub` as userId; enforce RBAC if applicable.
- Document API changes in OpenAPI or AppSync schema; include error cases.
- Create/update React component/page; connect API calls with proper loading/error/empty states.
- Add form validation (zod/HTML5); ensure accessibility (labels, roles, keyboard navigation).
- Use Tailwind utilities for responsive layout; ensure mobile and desktop breakpoints.

Acceptance Criteria (ALL must be met):
- Unit tests created and passing for all new code paths (task only succeeds if tests pass).
- Integration tests pass for end-to-end flow in dev.
- UAT scenario verified using acceptance steps; expected UX and API outputs confirmed.
- Static analysis, type checks, and security scans pass with no high/critical issues.
- Documentation updated (README/OpenAPI/AppSync schema).

Notes:
- Use structured JSON logs and defensive error handling.
- Secrets via SSM/KMS; never hardcode.
- Prefer idempotent operations for external calls.
