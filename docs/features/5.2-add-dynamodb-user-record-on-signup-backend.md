**Labels:** `Phase 1 – Foundation` (sky)

**Dependencies:**

> Dependencies: 5.1,4.1

### Description
Objective: Execute **5.2 – Add DynamoDB user record on signup (backend)** with precise steps that an AI agent can follow to completion.
Phase: Phase 1 – Foundation
Category: Auto-Inferred
Primary Domain(s): Infrastructure (Terraform/CloudFormation, AWS)
Dependencies: 5.1,4.1

Detailed Steps:
- Update Terraform/CloudFormation templates; plan/apply in dev; capture outputs in SSM/ENV.
- Configure CloudWatch logs/alarms/dashboards for the component; define rollback steps.

Acceptance Criteria (ALL must be met):
- Unit tests created and passing for all new code paths (task only succeeds if tests pass).
- Integration tests pass for end-to-end flow in dev.
- UAT scenario verified using acceptance steps; expected UX and API outputs confirmed.
- Static analysis, type checks, and security scans pass with no high/critical issues.
- Documentation updated (README/OpenAPI/AppSync schema).

Notes:
- Use structured JSON logs and defensive error handling.
- Secrets via SSM/KMS; never hardcode.
- Prefer idempotent operations for external calls.

Implementation Hints:
- Follow repository patterns for data access; include retries with backoff where relevant.
- Co-locate unit tests with modules (`tests/` for backend; `.test.tsx` for React components).
- Include Terraform plan in PR as evidence; document variables and state usage.
