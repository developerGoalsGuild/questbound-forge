# Discarded Quest Features

This document tracks advanced quest features that were considered but not implemented in the current Tasks 6.1-6.4 implementation. These features may be implemented in future phases when resources and requirements justify them.

## Quest Templates & Sharing (6.3)

### Discarded: Template Marketplace/Browse Feature
**Reason**: Not included in current scope to keep implementation focused
**Description**: A public marketplace where users could browse and search quest templates created by other users
**Requirements if implemented**:
- Template discovery UI with search and filtering
- Template rating and review system
- Geographic restrictions for data residency compliance
- Content moderation for public templates
- Attribution system for template creators
- Template usage analytics

### Discarded: Template Creation from Existing Quests
**Reason**: Complexity of separating active quest data from template structure
**Description**: Allow users to save existing active quests as templates
**Requirements if implemented**:
- Data extraction logic to remove active quest state
- User consent for template creation
- Privacy migration (active quest privacy â†’ template privacy)
- Template deduplication logic

## Quest Analytics (6.4)

### Discarded: AI-Powered Quest Recommendations
**Reason**: Marked as "future premium feature" in requirements
**Description**: ML-powered recommendations for quest difficulty, timing, and categories
**Requirements if implemented**:
- User behavior analysis and pattern recognition
- Recommendation engine (could use existing NLP libraries)
- A/B testing framework for recommendation effectiveness
- User feedback system for recommendation quality
- Premium feature gating and subscription integration

## Quest Notifications (6.2)

### Discarded: Real-time Notifications
**Reason**: Current scope uses periodic refresh cycle
**Description**: WebSocket-based real-time notifications for immediate quest updates
**Requirements if implemented**:
- WebSocket server integration
- Real-time connection management
- Battery optimization for mobile devices
- Offline queue for missed notifications
- Notification delivery guarantees

## Quest Progress Visualization (6.1)

### Discarded: Advanced Progress Visualizations
**Reason**: Current scope focuses on basic progress bars
**Description**: Advanced charts, gamification elements, and interactive progress displays
**Requirements if implemented**:
- Interactive progress charts with drill-down capabilities
- Gamification elements (badges, achievements, progress animations)
- Progress prediction algorithms
- Social comparison features
- Progress milestone celebrations

## Quest Templates & Sharing (6.3)

### Discarded: Template Version Control
**Reason**: Overkill for initial template system
**Description**: Version history and updates for quest templates
**Requirements if implemented**:
- Template versioning system
- Backward compatibility for template updates
- User notifications for template changes
- Template fork/clone functionality

## Goal Form Validation (13.2)

### Discarded: Real-time Goal Validation Endpoints
**Reason**: Current goal form validation is sufficient for MVP, real-time validation adds unnecessary complexity
**Description**: Backend endpoints for real-time validation of goal titles, deadlines, and categories during form input
**Requirements if implemented**:
- Title uniqueness validation endpoint (`GET /quests/validate/title`)
- Deadline validation endpoint (`GET /quests/validate/deadline`)
- Goal categories endpoint (`GET /quests/categories`)
- Enhanced error response models with field-level validation
- Comprehensive unit tests for validation logic
- Real-time form validation integration

### Discarded: Advanced Goal Validation Logic
**Reason**: Current Pydantic validation and basic sanitization provide adequate validation
**Description**: Enhanced validation with business rules, title uniqueness checking, and advanced deadline validation
**Requirements if implemented**:
- Title uniqueness checking across user's goals
- Advanced deadline validation with business rules (minimum time, working days)
- Enhanced error response models with detailed field validation
- Validation caching for performance optimization
- Comprehensive validation test coverage

## General Discarded Features

### Quest Collaboration Features
**Description**: Multi-user quests, quest delegation, and collaborative goal setting
**Reason**: Significantly increases complexity, better as separate feature

### Quest Scheduling and Automation
**Description**: Automated quest creation based on user patterns, scheduled quest starts
**Reason**: Advanced feature requiring significant ML integration

### Quest Social Features
**Description**: Quest sharing on social media, public leaderboards, quest challenges
**Reason**: Social features are separate product concern

### Quest Integration with External Services
**Description**: Calendar integration, task manager sync, fitness tracker integration
**Reason**: API integrations are separate technical initiative

## Future Implementation Considerations

### Prerequisites for Reconsideration
- **Market Validation**: User research showing demand for these features
- **Resource Availability**: Development team bandwidth and expertise
- **Technical Debt**: Current codebase stability and performance
- **Business Value**: ROI analysis for feature complexity

### Implementation Order Recommendations
1. Template marketplace (high user value, moderate complexity)
2. Real-time notifications (immediate UX improvement)
3. AI recommendations (premium feature differentiation)
4. Advanced visualizations (gamification enhancement)

### Technical Dependencies
- **Template Marketplace**: Requires content moderation infrastructure
- **Real-time Notifications**: Needs WebSocket infrastructure
- **AI Recommendations**: Requires ML model training and serving
- **Advanced Visualizations**: May need chart library evaluation

## Documentation Updates Needed

When implementing any discarded features:
- Update this document to reflect new implementation status
- Create detailed feature specifications
- Update architecture diagrams
- Add to testing and deployment checklists
- Update user documentation and guides
