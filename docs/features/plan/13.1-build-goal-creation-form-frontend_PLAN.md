## Overview
Restructure the goals functionality into separate, focused pages following the project's architectural patterns:

1. **Goals.tsx** - Goal editing page with task management (remove goal list, add task modal button)
2. **GoalsList.tsx** - Goals listing page with edit/delete actions
3. **GoalCreationForm.tsx** - Dedicated goal creation form component
4. **Dashboard Integration** - Add goals button to dashboard for easy access

This separation provides better user experience with focused functionality on each page, following the project's established patterns for form components, validation, accessibility features, and responsive design.
