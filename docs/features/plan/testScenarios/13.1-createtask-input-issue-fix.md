# 13.1 CreateTask Input Issue Fix

## Issue
The CreateTaskModal was not allowing users to type any values - input fields were immediately clearing/returning to empty state, deleting characters as the user typed.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was likely caused by one or more of the following:

1. **useEffect Dependencies**: The form reset useEffect had problematic dependencies (`clearError`, `clearAll`, `focusFirst`) that were changing on every render, causing the effect to run repeatedly and reset form fields.

2. **Focus Management Interference**: The `useFocusManagement` hook might have been interfering with input handling.

3. **ARIA Live Announcements**: The `useARIALiveAnnouncements` hook might have been causing side effects.

4. **Network Status Hook**: The `useNetworkStatus` hook might have been causing re-renders.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed useEffect Dependencies
**Before:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isOpen) {
    // ... reset form fields
    clearError();
    clearAll();
    setTimeout(() => {
      focusFirst();
    }, 100);
  }
}, [isOpen, clearError, clearAll, focusFirst]); // Problematic dependencies
```

**After:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isOpen) {
    // ... reset form fields
    // Temporarily removed clearError() and clearAll() to test
  }
}, [isOpen]); // Only isOpen dependency

// Separate effect for focus
useEffect(() => {
  if (isOpen) {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      const firstInput = document.querySelector('#task-title') as HTMLInputElement;
      if (firstInput) {
        firstInput.focus();
      }
    }, 200);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [isOpen]);
```

### 2. Temporarily Disabled Complex Hooks
To isolate the issue, temporarily disabled:

- `useFocusManagement` hook
- `useARIALiveAnnouncements` hook  
- `useNetworkStatus` hook

**Replaced with simple implementations:**
```typescript
// Focus management - temporarily disabled for testing
const containerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
const focusFirstError = () => false;
const focusFirst = () => false;
const handleKeyDown = () => {};

// ARIA live announcements - temporarily disabled for testing
const announce = () => {};
const clearAll = () => {};

// Network status - temporarily disabled for testing
const isOnline = true;
const hasError = false;
const errorMessage = '';
const setNetworkError = () => {};
const clearError = () => {};
```

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Form Test
- Test if input fields work without complex hooks
- Verify form submission works
- Check if validation works

### Phase 2: Gradual Re-enablement
- Re-enable hooks one by one to identify the problematic one
- Test after each re-enablement

### Phase 3: Final Fix
- Apply proper fix based on findings
- Restore all functionality

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/modals/CreateTaskModal.tsx` - Applied temporary fixes

## Expected Outcome
The CreateTaskModal should now allow users to type in input fields without the values being immediately cleared.

## Next Steps
1. Test the basic form functionality
2. If working, gradually re-enable hooks to identify the root cause
3. Apply proper fix and restore full functionality
4. Test all features work correctly

## Debugging Notes
- The issue was likely caused by useEffect dependencies causing infinite re-renders
- Complex hooks might have been causing side effects
- Simple approach first, then gradual complexity restoration
