# Quest Hooks and i18n Plan (Tasks 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)

## Scope
- Implement custom quest hooks (Task 2.3) in `frontend/src/hooks/useQuest.ts`.
- Create merged quest translations file with `en`, `es`, `fr` (Tasks 3.1–3.3) in `frontend/src/i18n/quest.ts` and aggregate via `frontend/src/i18n/translations.ts`.
- Ensure no breaking changes to existing `frontend/src/models/quest.ts` and `frontend/src/lib/apiQuest.ts`.

## References
- Aggregator: `frontend/src/i18n/translations.ts`
- Models: `frontend/src/models/quest.ts`
- API: `frontend/src/lib/apiQuest.ts`
- Feature spec: `docs/features/plan/22.4-create-user-quests-related-to-goal.md`

## Task 2.3 — Custom Hooks (`frontend/src/hooks/useQuest.ts`)

### Exports
- `useQuests({ goalId? })`
- `useQuestCreate()`
- `useQuestStart()`
- `useQuestEdit()`
- `useQuestCancel()`
- `useQuestFail()`
- `useQuestDelete()`
- `useQuestProgress(quest)`

### Typing and Contracts
- Reuse types and schemas from `frontend/src/models/quest.ts`: `Quest`, `QuestCreateInput`, `QuestUpdateInput`, `QuestCancelInput`, Zod schemas.
- Consume `frontend/src/lib/apiQuest.ts` functions only; do not change their signatures or behavior.

### State and Behavior
- Shared shape:
  - `quests: Quest[]`
  - `loadingStates: Record<string, boolean>`
  - `error: string | null`
  - `validationErrors: Record<string, string>`
  - `selectedQuest: Quest | null`
- Optimistic updates with rollback for create/edit/cancel/fail/delete.
- Stable callbacks via `useCallback`; derived values via `useMemo`.
- Per-operation `AbortController`, cancel on unmount.
- Debounced validation (300ms) using Zod schemas.

### Accessibility and UX
- Expose operation flags for buttons: `disabled={loadingStates[key] || submitting || hasValidationErrors}`.
- Optional `onAnnounce(message, priority)` callback for ARIA live region integration.

### Error Handling and Logging
- Normalize errors, surface user-friendly messages.
- Structured logs include: `status`, `statusText`, `errorBody`, `url`, `sanitized input`, `timestamp`.

### Performance and Correctness
- Avoid unstable function deps in effects.
- Batch state updates to minimize re-renders.

### Tests
- `frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/useQuest.test.tsx`:
  - Happy and error paths for all operations
  - Optimistic update + rollback
  - Debounced validation and clearing on change
  - Abort on unmount
  - Stable dependencies (no infinite loops)

## Tasks 3.1–3.3 — i18n (Merged en/es/fr)

### Files
- `frontend/src/i18n/quest.ts`
  - `interface QuestTranslations` exactly per spec
  - `questTranslations: Record<Language, QuestTranslations>` with `en`, `es`, `fr`
- Update `frontend/src/i18n/translations.ts` to include `quest` under exported translations.

### Key Structure and Alignment
- Status keys: `quest.status.{draft|active|completed|cancelled|failed}`
- Difficulty keys: `quest.difficulty.{easy|medium|hard}`
- Matches helpers in `models/quest.ts` (`getQuestStatusKey`, `getQuestDifficultyKey`).

### Usage
- Access via `useTranslation()`, safely: `(t as any)?.quest` with English fallback.
- Log missing keys in development; never break rendering.

### Tests
- Minimal tests asserting required roots and core keys exist in `en`, `es`, `fr`.

## Non-Breaking Guarantees
- No signature changes to `frontend/src/lib/apiQuest.ts` or `frontend/src/models/quest.ts`.
- Aggregator `frontend/src/i18n/translations.ts` retains existing keys; only adds `quest`.
- Hooks are additive in a new file; existing components remain unaffected.
