# Plan: Implementing Quest UI Components (Tasks 4.1 - 4.5)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a detailed plan for a junior developer to implement the core UI components for the "Quests" feature, as specified in `docs/features/plan/22.4-create-user-quests-related-to-goal.md`. The tasks covered are 4.1 through 4.5, which constitute "Phase 4: Core UI Components".

The primary goal is to build these components in a way that is robust, accessible, localized, and doesn't break any existing functionality. We will proceed by first creating mock data and services to allow for independent UI development.

## 2. Prerequisites & Initial Setup

The UI components depend on data models, API hooks, and translation files that are part of Phase 2 and 3. To unblock development, we will start by creating mock versions of these dependencies.

**Action Item:** Before starting the component work, create the following mock files:

1.  **Mock Data (`frontend/src/lib/mocks/quests.ts`):**
    *   Create a file to export mock `Quest` objects. Include quests with different statuses (`draft`, `active`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `failed`), types (`linked`, `quantitative`), and difficulties. This will be used to build and test the UI components without a real backend.
    *   Refer to `frontend/src/models/quest.ts` for the `Quest` interface. If it doesn't exist, create a temporary version based on the feature document.

2.  **Mock Hooks (`frontend/src/hooks/useQuest.mock.ts`):**
    *   Create a mock version of `useQuest.ts`.
    *   Implement mock hooks like `useQuests`, `useQuest`, etc., that return the mock data from the previous step. They should also simulate loading and error states.

3.  **Mock Translations (`frontend/src/i18n/quest/en.mock.ts`):**
    *   Create a temporary English translation file for quests. You can fill it with placeholder text initially, following the structure defined in `QuestTranslations` interface in the feature document.
