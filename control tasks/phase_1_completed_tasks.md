*Total Completed Tasks: 34*

## Implementation Notes
- **Strong Foundation**: Authentication, basic CRUD operations, and core schemas are well-implemented
- **AWS Infrastructure**: All AWS services (DynamoDB, Cognito, S3, API Gateway) are deployed and configured
- **UI/UX**: Good progress on frontend components, but some dedicated pages missing
- **Advanced Features**: Progress tracking, collaboration, and real-time chat are major gaps

*Overall Completion: ~55% of Phase 1 tasks*
