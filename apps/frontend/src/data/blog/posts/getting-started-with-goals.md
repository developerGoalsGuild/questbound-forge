# Getting Started with Goals: A Beginner's Guide

Setting goals is easy, but achieving them requires strategy, planning, and persistence. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to create and achieve your first goal on GoalsGuild.

## Step 1: Define Your Goal

Start with a clear, specific goal. Instead of "get fit," try "run a 5K in under 30 minutes by March 2024." Specific goals are easier to plan and track.

### Tips for Goal Setting:

- **Be Specific**: Clearly define what success looks like
- **Make it Measurable**: Include numbers or metrics
- **Set a Deadline**: Give yourself a realistic timeline
- **Make it Achievable**: Challenge yourself, but stay realistic

## Step 2: Break It Down

Every big goal consists of smaller tasks. Break your goal into milestones and individual tasks. For example:

- **Milestone 1**: Build up to running 1 mile
- **Milestone 2**: Run 2 miles continuously
- **Milestone 3**: Complete a 5K run
- **Final Goal**: Run 5K in under 30 minutes

## Step 3: Create Tasks

Within each milestone, create specific tasks:

- Week 1: Run 3 times, 10 minutes each
- Week 2: Run 3 times, 15 minutes each
- Week 3: Run 4 times, 20 minutes each
- And so on...

## Step 4: Track Your Progress

Regularly update your progress on GoalsGuild. Mark tasks as complete, update your progress percentage, and celebrate small wins along the way.

## Step 5: Stay Accountable

Join a guild related to your goal, or invite friends to collaborate. Having others aware of your goal increases accountability and motivation.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Setting too many goals at once**: Focus on 2-3 goals maximum
2. **Being too vague**: Specificity is key to success
3. **Skipping the planning phase**: Break down your goal before starting
4. **Giving up after setbacks**: Persistence is more important than perfection

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, create your first goal on GoalsGuild and start your journey to success!
