The quest system is one of GoalsGuild's most engaging features. It transforms goal achievement into a game, making progress fun and motivating. Let's explore how it works.

## What Are Quests?

Quests are special challenges that reward you with XP (experience points) and badges when completed. They're designed to gamify your goal achievement journey.

### Qualitative Quests

Focus on quality or completion:
- Complete a course
- Finish a project
- Master a skill

## Earning XP

Every quest completion earns you XP. The amount depends on:
- Quest difficulty (easy, medium, hard)
- Quest complexity
- Your current level

### XP Benefits
